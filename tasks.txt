- *(2)configuration file with datasource information(database connection)
- you can make soapconnection class inherite from connection abstract
- *(4)create a class classe ya user, class transaction, class ya booking, )
- (8)later have a look at bootstrap countries and cities
- user class transaction class and booking class should be inherite from dataHandler
- functions such as insert update and select in the datahandler will take as  parameter the table name, array with key and value containing name of the talble elements and values
- later we should be able to set the table name in the constructor,
- insert and search should be function of either dataHandler or controller.
- read  about mock and PHP mock
- create a class cal and mock that class such that we have a success and  code 200 for successful transaction, failed and code 200 for failed transaction. pass those information to soap response

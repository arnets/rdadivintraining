- *(2)configuration file with datasource information(database connection)
- you can make soapconnection class inherite from connection abstract
- *(4)create a classes folder in which we put all our classes(e.g. classe ya user, class transaction, class ya booking, )
- (8)later have a look at bootstrap countries and cities
- user class transaction class and booking class should be inherite from dataHandler
- functions such as instert update and select in the datahandler will take as  parameter the table name, array with key and value containing name of the talble elements and values
- later we should be able to set the table name in the constructor,
- instert and search should be function of either dataHandler or controller.
- read  about mock and php mock
